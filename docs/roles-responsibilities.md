## Workers

Anyone can contribute to the DAO by engaging eith the community on Keybase, creating new Issues on GitHub, working on open Issues on GitHub. This does not require anyone's permission. Reviewers can assign tasks to the contributor's GitHub account and pay out `MRT` bounties to the worker's Ethereum address upon successful completion. This does not require any permissions within the 1Hive DAO.
