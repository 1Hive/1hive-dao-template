# 1Hive Template

## Usage

Create new tokens and initialize DAO for a 1Hive project:

```
template.prepareInstance(mbrTokenName, mrtTokenName, mbrTokenSymbol, mrtTokenSymbol)
```

- `mbrTokenName`: Name for the token used by Members in the organization
- `mbrTokenSymbol`: Symbol for the token used by Members in the organization
- `mrtTokenName`: Name for the token used to reward Merit in the organization
- `mrtTokenSymbol`: Symbol for the token used to reward Merit in the organization

Setup 1Hive DAO:

```
template.setupInstance(name, memberHolders, memberVoteSettings, meritVoteSettings, dotVoteQuorum)
```

- `name`: Name for org, will assign `[name].aragonid.eth`
- `memberHolders`: Array of member addresses (1 token will be minted for each member)
- `memberVoteSettings`: Array of [supportRequired, minAcceptanceQuorum, voteDuration] for votes by the organization's members
- `meritVoteSettings`: Array of [supportRequired, minAcceptanceQuorum, voteDuration] for votes by the organization's merit holders
- `dotVoteQuorum`:  the quorum required for the dot voting app

## Deploying templates

After deploying ENS, APM and AragonID, just run:

```
npm run deploy:rinkeby
```

The network details will be automatically selected by the `arapp.json`'s environments.
